# Leo SF Symbols

This collection of SF Symbols is automatically generated from the icons in [Leo](https://github.com/brave/leo/tree/main/icons)

## Automatic Updates

Start the https://github.com/brave/leo-sf-symbols/actions/workflows/update.yml
and the symbols will automatically be updated to what's in the latest version
of [Leo](https://github.com/brave/leo).

When https://github.com/brave/leo/pull/259 lands, this action will be run
automatically when branches are merged.

## Manually Updating

1. Run `npm update-leo` to upgrade to latest Leo (which may have new icons)
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate symbols

Once the `sf-icons` branch in Leo lands we can automatically update Leo.
