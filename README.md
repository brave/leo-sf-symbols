# Leo SF Symbols

This collection of SF Symbols is automatically generated from the icons in [Leo](https://github.com/brave/leo/tree/main/icons)

## Updating

1. Run `npm update-leo` to upgrade to latest Leo (which may have new icons)
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate symbols

Once the `sf-icons` branch in Leo lands we can automatically update Leo.
